# Quick Search on SoundCloud/Spotify Chrome Extensions Pack

These Chrome Extensions allow you to highlight text on and quickly search the selected text on Spotify or SoundCloud. 
Right-click and selecting the your desired platform from the context menu. 
I've designed this to help myself and others quickly and seamlessly search for music on two major music libary platforms.
